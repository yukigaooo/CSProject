			<h1><strong>FACTORING</strong></h1>
			<p>For the easy case of factoring, you will find two numbers that will not only multiply to equal the constant term "c", but also add up to equal "b".For example :X^2-3x+2 can be complete factoring the answer is (x-1) (x-2), but this is not the final answer, you need to set both factor as x-1=0 and x-2=0, and then you can find out two x's answer, which is x=1 and x=2. However, some equation can not be solved this way,a formula is used to solve it. Answers always have 2 solutions. They can be either rational or irrational. However, in some cases the equation can only get one solution because the solutions are the same. Example question : solve for X^2+4x+3=0 
Answer : (x+3) (x+1)
x=-3			x=-1

			<h1><strong>FUNCTIONS</strong></h1>
			<p> A function relates an input to an output. f(x) = ... " is the classic way of writing a function.  Basically a function is that the same x value can not have more than 1 y value.  Moreover, for function, in one  x value you can not have more than one value. For example {(1,0),(2,0),(3,1)} could be a function. But {(1,0),(1,1), (1,2)} can not be a function because the x value which is one has more than 1 y value . </p>

			<h1><strong>QUADRATIC EQUATIONS</strong></h1>
			<p>Often, the simplest way to solve "ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c= 0" for the value of x is to factor the quadratic, set each factor equal to zero, and then solve each factor. But sometimes the quadratic is too messy, or it doesn't factor at all, or you just don't feel like factoring. While factoring may not always be successful, the Quadratic Formula can always find the solution.it has three ways to ask for the solution:what is the x coeffction ? where will the y intercept attach to the line ? and solve for the quadratic equation .
			How to solve for the x coefficient?  
			Find the largest value that can be factored from each of the elements of the expression,and then think about which value  can be multiply and it also equal to c . then if you can find out two number the attach the the x intercept.
			2 where will the y intercept attach to the line ?
			You need to use the equation w(x+k)+y to factor out all the number , so you can find you what is the y intercept for the equation .
			3 solve for quadratic equation .
			You need to use the formula to solve it . first we need to know the equation is ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0 so we can put in the number one by one 
			In order to get the solution for x , you need to know the standard form is ax^2+bx+c=0. moreover , you need to know how to factor the x value also. For example if the equation is X^2+5x+6=0. The answer will be x=-2 and x =-3.
			This is the step for solving a quartic equation:
			1.Write the equation in standard form :(x^2+5x+6=0)
			2.Factoring completely : x+3 x+2
			3.Apply the zero product rule: x+3=0 , x+2=0
			4.Solve the equation for x:	x=-3   x=-2
			However, in some cases you are not able to solve the equation completely  based on factoring. So you need to use the formula  to do it . (this is equation is only used for when the you can not factor the number completely)

			<h1><strong>SLOPE</strong></h1>
			<p>Equation y=mx+b where b is the y intercept that is attached to the the x-axis , m is the slope for the equation. If m is negative the slope will go down, if n is possible it will considering a possible line. Example : y=2x+3  and y=2x-3 are all possible slope. How to calculate slope? as shown on the picture, if you want to find a slope of the line you need to use the equation y2-y1/x2-x1 so for this line the equation will be ⅔ x and the y intercept is where the line intercept with the y axis. Which is 0.5. So we can determine the line as y=2/3x+0.5
			STEPS
			Step 1: Put the equation in Slope Intercept Form
			Step 2: Graph the y-intercept point (the number in the b position) on the y-axis.
			Step 3: From the point plotted on the y-axis, use the slope to find your second point. Remember, the slope is the number in the m position in your equation.
			Step 4: Draw your line using the two points you plotted (y-intercept (b) first, slope (m) second. Be sure your line is pointing the right way.

			<h1><strong>POLYNOMIALS</strong></h1>
			<p>An expression that can have constants, variables and exponents, that can be combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, but:


			• no division by a variable.
			• a variable's exponents can only be 0,1,2,3,... etc.
			• it can't have an infinite number of terms.
